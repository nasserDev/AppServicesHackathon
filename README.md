# Azure App Services Hackathon for Saudi ISVs #


Welcome to #AppServicesHackathon where we are going to work for the next 48 hours to solve real issues from your working environment using Azure App Services, specially Azure Functions and Azure Web Apps. These are the criteria you should follow:

1- Chose a real case scenario from your business,  a problem you already have or a new feature that can be implemented in one of your products.

2- Use Azure Functions or/and Azure Web Apps to be the main component of your solution.

3- You still can use any other Azure or non-Azure technology. Feel free to innovate and integrate with any other service (i.e: Cognitive Services, PowerBI Embeded, Bots .. etc)

4- That's all, prepare your project to be presented at 3:30 PM the 2nd day of the hackathon. You have 10 mins to present.
